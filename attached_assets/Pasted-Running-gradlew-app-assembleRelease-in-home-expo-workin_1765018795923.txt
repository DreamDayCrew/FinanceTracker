Running 'gradlew :app:assembleRelease' in /home/expo/workingdir/build/mobile/android
Welcome to Gradle 8.3!
Here are the highlights of this release:
- Faster Java compilation
 - Reduced memory usage
 - Support for running on Java 20
For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/8.3/release-notes.html
To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.3/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build
